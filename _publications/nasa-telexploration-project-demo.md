NASAâ€™s Telexploration Project seeks to make us better explorers by building immersive environments that feel like we are really there. The Mission Operations Innovation Office and its Operations Laboratory at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) founded the Telexploration Project, and is researching how immersive visualization and natural human-robot interaction can enable mission scientists, engineers, and the general public to interact with NASA spacecraft and alien environments in a more effective way. These efforts have been accelerated through partnerships with many different companies, especially in the video game industry. These demos will exhibit some of the progress made at NASA and its commercial partnerships by allowing attendees to experience Mars data acquired from NASA spacecraft in a head mounted display using several rendering and interaction techniques.
