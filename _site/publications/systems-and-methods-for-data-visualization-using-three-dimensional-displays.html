    <h1>Systems And Methods For Data Visualization Using Three Dimensional Displays</h1>
<h2>United States Patent and Trade Office</h2>

<p>Data visualization systems and methods for generating 3D visualizations of a multidimensional data space are described. In one embodiment a 3D data visualization application directs a processing system to:load a set of multidimensional data points into a visualization table; create representations of a set of 3D objects corresponding to the set of data points;receive mappings of data dimensions to visualization atributes; determine the visualization atributes of the set of 3D objects based upon the selected mappings of datad imensions to 3D object atributes; update a visibility dimension in the visualization table for each of the plurality of 3D object to reflect the visibility of each 3D object based upon the selected mappings of data dimensions to visualization atributes; and interactively render 3D data visualizations of the 3D objects within the virtual space from viewpoints determined based upon received user input.</p>
