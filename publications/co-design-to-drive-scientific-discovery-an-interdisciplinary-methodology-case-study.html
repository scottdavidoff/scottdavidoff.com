    <h1>Co-Design to drive scientific discovery: An Interdisciplinary visualization methodology case study</h1>
<h2>Information Plus Conference</h2>

<p>The Data to Discovery program investigates how experimental interdisciplinary collaborations in computing, art, co-design and research enable and critically engage scientific discovery. This NASA JPL/Caltech/ ArtCenter College of Design collaboration frames interactive data visualization in science and engineering as a unique transdisciplinary practice and mode of knowledge production. Our presentation addresses two key design objectives: how to best design interactive data visualization systems in complex scientific domains with real-world, mission critical applications. And, how to develop a methodology, based on interdisciplinary best practices, that addresses diverse processes and application domains to prioritize learning for interns and discovery for scientists and engineers.</p>
